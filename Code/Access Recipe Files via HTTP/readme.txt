Access Recipe Files via HTTP - Extra Info

Currently, recipe files (.xml) are stored on an arbitrary web server.
In this root folder is a .txt file containing the names of the .xml files stored there.

The Recipe Browser class looks through this .txt file and shows the files available to download to the user.

Then, the user can select any of these files to download to a local destination.
