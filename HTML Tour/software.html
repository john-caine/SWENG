  <h1>Software</h1>
  <p>Spoon's software team comprised of Steve Thorpe (Software Manager), Jonathan Caine (Development Manager) and Roger Tan (Testing and Integration Manager).</p>
  <p>Using Agile methodologies, the software team led the product development process from design to implementation and testing.</p>
  <p>All documentation relating to the software side of the project is included below, along with any other documents generated by the software team.</p>
  <h5>GDS/IDS</h5>
  <p>After consulting with our Line Manager, Stuart Porter, we were informed that we should only create documentation that the company felt would benefit or be of use to it, not simply generate documentation for the sake of documentation. Consequently following the Agile methodologies that we as a company had adopted, we decided not to produce IDS/GDS documents. This is because they are not a very Agile way of working due to the fact they would inevitably have required constantly changing, due to the continuing refactoring of code. Both the Software Manager and Development Manager, strongly felt that the combination of Test Driven Development and Agile methodologies, meant that IDS/GDS documentation was therefore redundant. Instead the combination of our Functional Specification, and list of user stories were used as a general specification, with the underlying implementation being left open to the programmers assigned to a task, as recommended in the Agile methodologies.</p>

      <h4>User Stories and Sprint Plans</h4></a>
      <p>This document contains the 'Sprint Plan' for the project (from Sprint 3 onwards) and contains a list of user stories for these sprints.</p>
      <p>A full list of user stories was provided on JIRA, the software development tracking system we chose to use for the project.</p>

      <h4>Iteration Reports</h4>
      <p>The iteration reports for the project were prepared by the software manager and contain detailed information about the work carried out in each iteration, timing and record of issues.</p>

      <h4>Sprint Reports</h4></a>	
      <p>This document represents an example sprint report which the software manager produced at the end of each sprint, using data from the tracking tool JIRA. Comparing estimates with actual figures of time spent working, these reports aided the software manager with providing task estimates and assigning future work.</p>

      <br />
      <h4>Software Architecture Design</h4>
      <p>Using agile, most of the design work was not formally dictated by documentation, however, at several stages during the project, it was helpful to produce technical documentation.</p>
      <p>An overview of the software architecture design is included, along with a more detailed view of the eCook core class structure (at an early stage of the project) and the Recipe data map.</p>

      <h4>Test and Integration Plan</h4></a>
      <p>This document contains the test and integration plan, created by the Testing and Integration Manager.</p>
      <p>It details the formal plan for all testing throughout the software development process, following the principles of test-driven development (TDD).</p>

    <br>
      <h4>Testing Standards</h4>
      <p>The testing standards document outlines the recommended procedures for all testing in the project.</p>
      <p>The review document was created as part of series of regular reviews that took place to ensure that the testing standards were met at all times during the project.</p>

    <div class="col3" align="center"><a href="documentation/software/eCook's DTP Record.xlsx"> <img src="images/file_img.png" width="200" height="200" alt="" title="" border="0" style="margin-bottom:125px"/><br />
      <br />
      <h4>DTP Records</h4></a>	
      <p>This document contains the deterministic pass test (DTP) record, which was a series of tests (mostly visual) that were to be carried out at the point of integrating a module.</p>
      <p>The purpose of these tests was to ensure that by integrating a module or conducting bug fixes, the original functionality of the product was unaltered (not broken!).</p>
      <p>Using JIRA, the test results were uploaded to the relevant ticket for review by the testing and integration manager and/or the software manager.</p>
      <p>The project DTP records are available <a href="../Documents/Software/Testing and Integration/DTP Records">here</a>.</p>

      <br />
      <h4>Integration Guidelines</h4></a>
      <p>In addition to the testing standards, the development manager also provides some integration guidelines to assist with the process of integrating a module or fixes into the eCook product. This proved to be helpful to team members who were previously unsure of the integration process and the associated testing procedures required.</p>

      <h4>User Interface Design (GUI)</h4></a>
      <p>This document contains the basic GUI design for the latest version of the product. It was decided that this document would be useful for the team as many people were working on the GUI classes at any one time so it was important for everyone to have a clear idea of what was expected.</p>
